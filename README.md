Temperature Sensor
=================

This is a simple Temp Sensor based on an attiny85, AHT20 temp/humidity sensor and
a cheap RF 433MHz module (ref. FS1000A).

The sensor is aimed to be installed outside the house and send periodically 
temperature and humidity data to a Weather Station.

This repo contains the code used.
